# Robot Arm Project

## 1. Introduction

The robot you will be working with is Niryo One. I suggest you to take a look at their website and familiarize yourself 
with the robot both on hardware and sofware levels (check [this](https://niryo.com/docs/niryo-one/) link). Since I spent 
most of my time trying to interact with the Niryo through Robotic Operating System (ROS) most of my topics in the following 
sections are ros-related topics. However, as far as I am concerned you are not bound to use ROS (I may be wrong!!!). For instance, 
you can directly interact with Niryou through Niryou one studio (link [here](https://github.com/NiryoRobotics/niryo_one_ros)). 
As you can see in [this](https://github.com/NiryoRobotics/niryo_one_ros) page there are two requirements to run Niryo one in 
simulation mode; Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS kinetic. Before you get started with ROS make sure whether your work/project depends on it
or not so you don't have to go through unnecessary hassle!

## 2. Robot Operating System (ROS)

### 2.1 Installation and Tutorials

You can check the official ROS website [here](https://www.ros.org/). In order to install Ros Kinetic (from now on I refer to 
it as kinetic) I suggest you to follow the instructions [here](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu). Once you are done 
with the installation just follow the tutorials ([here](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)) to become familiar with ROS. I, strongly,
recommend you to go through the "Core ROS Tutorials" beginner level topics in the same page as these topics are essential in 
understanding ROS.
 
### 2.2 Demos

Here I have provided a few demos of Niryo one and other robot arms in action:
